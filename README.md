# StackComparison
A C++ program to compare two stacks and determine if they are identical. Includes two stack classes (stack1 and stack2) with common operations like push, pop, display, and checks for emptiness and fullness. The main function prompts the user to input values for two stacks, displays their contents, and checks if the stacks are identical.
